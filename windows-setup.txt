To set up to run medley on Windows 10 Version 2004 (might work with earlier versions)
Install WSL 2.

When you get to the step 6 Install your Unix distribution of your choice:

I've only tried out Pengwin

     https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NV1GV1PXZ6P    

When you install it, it will ask you to run pengwin-setup which 
includes an X server option vcxsrv. Install it (it runs on the windows
side, installing on your-windows-home/.vcxsrv.) Another
that looks identical is xming:

     https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/

You might need to turn off access control to your X server
(in Windows 'xhost +' or turn it off when you xlaunch.)

When you're done installing X:

copy lde ldex from linux.x86_64 in the release directory
(or in maiko if you build your own) into your path (/usr/local/bin)

Stash these somewhere:

# the site-init is set up to use MEDLEYDIR
export MEDLEYDIR=/mnt/c/**path-to-medley-directory**
export LDEINIT="$MEDLEYDIR"/initfiles/local-init

# not sure if this is needed
export HOME=/mnt/c/path-to-windows-home

# WSL2 runs Linux as a virtual machine with a different IP address
export DISPLAY=<your machine's IP address>:0

# The maximum size of the medley screen is 2097152 = 2^21
lde -g 1440x800 -screen 1440x800 -d $DISPLAY $MEDLEYDIR/loadups/xfull35.sysout

# if you lose the X server you can restart it from
# ~/.vcxsrv/xlaunch.exe
